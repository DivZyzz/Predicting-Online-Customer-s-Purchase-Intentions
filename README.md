**Predicting Online Customerâ€™s Purchase Intentions using Machine Learning**

**Introduction**

The aim of this project was to predict whether online customers have an intention to make a purchase based on various attributes and interactions during their website sessions. Through classification and clustering techniques, the project aimed to improve understanding of customer behaviour and enhance conversion rates.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project is called "Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention." It contains a mixture of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes, where the 'Revenue' attribute serves as the class label. The dataset was designed to capture user behaviour over a one-year period, avoiding biases due to specific campaigns, special days, or user profiles.

**Methodology**

The project aimed to predict whether online customers would make a purchase or not. The dataset included various customer attributes and behavior metrics. Steps included data preparation, exploratory analysis, clustering analysis, feature importance assessment, model building (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, SVC), hyperparameter tuning, partial dependence analysis, and SHAP value interpretation. The Random Forest model performed best with an 89.48% accuracy, offering insights into customer behavior. The project showcased the potential of machine learning for predicting online purchasing behavior and guiding marketing strategies.

**Project Significance**

This project is significant for e-commerce platforms seeking to optimise their conversion rates. By understanding the attributes that influence purchasing intention, businesses can tailor their strategies to engage customers effectively, resulting in increased sales and revenue.
